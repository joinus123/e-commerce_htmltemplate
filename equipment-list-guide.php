                           <p>Working almost like a wedding or baby registry, our registry is easy to implement and use in a short amount of time. If you are looking for a way to simplify your fund-raising process for Training Equipment, the Equipment Registry is the answer. The following video provides a brief overview of the registry benefits:</p>

                        <p>The Equipment Registry is absolutely free and with an OatesSpecialties.com account is quick to set-up. Not having an OatesSpecalties.com account is not a problem, just create one, then set up the Equipment Registry and get a feel for what it is all about. All this with no cost and without commitments!</p>
                        <p>Setting up an Equipment Registry will empower your program benefactors to improve your training program. It will let your donors know what training tools you need and which ones have the greatest priority. Your sponsors can choose the equipment you need the most (and fits their budget) and send these high priority items directly to your program at the address plainly visible on the registry. Your patron will have no doubt how their donation was used.</p>
                        <p>Begin your Equipment Registry now by going to the top of this page and clicking ‘Equipment Registry’ or selecting the 'Equipment Registry' button below. If you don’t have an OatesSpecialties.com account, create one. If you have an account, log-in and begin identifying the items you want in your registry. It’s easy and fast!  </p>
